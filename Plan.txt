I will design objects as classes (e.g. a building class, a car class,
etc.). The classes don't do any rendering work or have any functions
associated with rendering--they're similar to the Bezier curve
class from Assignment 2. They just calculate coordinates. They should
also calculate normals to their surfaces, and they should really
calculate them as the average of surrounding normals so we can at
least do some nice Gouraud shading.

The actual objects in the scene will be represented by Vertex Array
Objects that hold on to Vertex buffer objects that have the coordinates,
colors, and so on. 

All the functions that go to GLUT will just be normal C-style global
functions, possibly defined in a separate file from the main
function. They may get a namespace (maybe the whole project will
have a namespace).
